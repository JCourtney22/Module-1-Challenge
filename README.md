# Challenges 
 
 One of the first challenges I came across was identifying how to make the broken link work. I explored the document to try and idenitfy patterns of code and I also used the inspect tool to try and locate variations in the code. I found that I couldn't identify the problem on my own so I used the internet to search how to create links that jump to specific places within a webpage. I found that I had simply overlooked the fact that CSS was being used inline and the id was being called in the link using the #and id name, however there was no id attribute associated with the call. Once I had created an appropriate id in the correct place, the link worked.
