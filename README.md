# Module-1-Challenge

*Short description here
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?*

For this challenge, I had the following user story to refer to so that my work was accurate and met the requirements.

### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

I began by exploring the code to get familiar with it and then focused on individual areas as opposed to as trying to focus on everything at once. This allowed me to ensure that any changes I made didn't cause further problems and to check that the CSS was still being applied correctly. Once I was happy with each change, I committed each one to allow me flexibility if I needed to revert to an older version of code.

# Challenges 
 
 One of the first challenges I came across was identifying how to make the broken link work. I explored the document to try and idenitfy patterns of code and I also used the inspect tool to try and locate variations in the code. I found that I couldn't identify the problem on my own so I used the internet to search how to create links that jump to specific places within a webpage. I found that I had simply overlooked the fact that CSS was being used inline and the id was being called in the link using the #and id name, however there was no id attribute associated with the call. Once I had created an appropriate id in the correct place, the link worked.
